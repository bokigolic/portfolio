## Personal Portfolio Project

Overview
Your personal portfolio is a responsive web application built using React and Next.js. The project showcases your skills, experience, and projects to potential employers, clients, or collaborators. With the use of media queries and responsive design techniques, your portfolio looks perfect on any device size.
