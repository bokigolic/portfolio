### Features

- About Me: A section that provides a comprehensive overview of my background, education, and professional experience.
- Projects: A showcase of my programming projects, including descriptions, screenshots, and links to the live demos or source code.
- Contact: A page where potential employers, clients, or collaborators can reach out to me via email, phone, or a contact form.

### Getting Started
To start the application, simply run the following commands in your terminal:

`npm install`
`npm run dev`

This will launch the development server and allow you to view your portfolio in your web browser.

### Dependencies
The project relies on several dependencies, including:

- Devicon: A library of icons for popular programming languages and tools. This library is used to display icons for the technologies used in my projects.
- Next.js: A framework for building server-side rendered React applications. Next.js provides many valuable features for building scalable and performant web applications.
- React and React-DOM: These are the core libraries for building user interfaces in React.
- React-Icons: A library of popular icons that can be easily used in React applications. This library is used to display icons for social media links, among other things.
- Styled Components: A library that allows you to write CSS styles in your JavaScript code. This library is used to style the components in my portfolio.
- Styled-Normalize: A library that provides a CSS reset to ensure consistent styling across different browsers. This library is used to normalize the styles in my portfolio.


### Customization
To customize the project, you can modify the content of the components in the /components directory. You can also modify the styles in the /styles directory.

### Deployment
I am excited to share that my portfolio is now live and accessible to the world, thanks to the reliable hosting services of HostGator.
